it like solves mazes and stuff

stole the idea to solve mazes from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rop0W4QDOUI also the way they formatted the mazes made it easy so the mazes have to be formatted in the same way.

****WAY TO FORMAT MAZES****

you need a black border (0,0,0 rgb) all the way around. one white pixel (255, 255, 255 rgb) in the first row of pixels and the on in the bottom row. These are the starting and ending ones. anything else in between is good. There is a portion that will check if the maze fits the requirements. Furthermore if it is unsolveable it will also say that. if u have any cool ideas to make it better tell me
